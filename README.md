This repository contains a a white paper, [“Development of Large Field of View Microscope for Mouse Brain Imaging”] ([REU 2021 Paper_jbs.pdf](https://github.com/Sockie3/sokolova-neuronex-reu-2021/blob/main/REU%202021%20Paper_jbs.pdf), as well as the presentation that I have at a conference for the NeuroNex Technology Hub, research Experience for Undergraduates in the summer of 2021. It also contains the python code for a power control device that I designed and created using the Raspberry Pi to facilitate two- and three-photon microscopy imaging.
