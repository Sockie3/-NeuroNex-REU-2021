# -NeuroNex-REU-2021
This repository contains a a white paper, “Development of Large Field of View Microscope for Mouse Brain Imaging”, as well as the presentation that I have at a conference for the NeuroNex Technology Hub, Research Experience for Undergraduates in the summer of 2021. It also contains the python code for a power control device that I designed and created using the Raspberry Pi to facilitate two- and three-photon microscopy imaging.
